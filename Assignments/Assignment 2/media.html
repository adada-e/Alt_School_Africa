  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi there! I'm a determined and tech-savvy individual with a passion for learning and growing in the ever-evolving world of technology. Currently, I work as an Application Support Specialist in the financial sector, where I manage and ensure the smooth operation of various banking applications.

    Outside of work, I enjoy playing computer games, watching movies, and meeting new people—things that keep me creative, curious, and socially engaged. My ultimate goal is to transition into a cloud engineering role, where I can leverage my skills to build, optimize, and innovate within cloud platforms.
    
    I thrive on challenges, especially when exploring new technologies under expert guidance. Whether it's solving complex problems or collaborating with others, I’m always eager to take the next step in my journey. Let's connect and grow together!.</p>
