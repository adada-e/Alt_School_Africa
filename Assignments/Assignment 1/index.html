    <p>
      I joined the Alt School of Engineering because of my strong passion for
      technology and problem-solving. With a background in application support
      at a financial institution, I have always been fascinated by how systems
      work and how they can be optimized for better performance. I chose this
      program to deepen my technical knowledge, especially in cloud engineering,
      and gain hands-on experience with modern technologies. <P>Alt School’s
      structured curriculum, mentorship, and project-based learning approach
      provide the perfect environment for me to grow as an engineer. My goal is
      to master cloud technologies, improve my coding skills, and ultimately
      transition into a cloud engineering role. I believe this program will
      equip me with the necessary skills and network to achieve my career
      aspirations. AltSchool has a proven record of student success. They not
      only impart knowledge but also provide a strong post-qualification setup
      for students, which is very encouraging. Additionally, their learning
      environment and flexible study mode are ideal for those who are currently
      working. Students can revisit missed classes and collaborate with other
